    <h1>This is What I Am About</h1>
    <p>What can I say about Volkswagens? A lot. My first obsession was a 1.8T. I worked with a guy that had a 1.8T GTI. He kept it clean and at that point I was driving a Dodge Stratus that had already blown a head-gasket. I repaired it with my dad and it ran for another 9 months. It was addictive. I never looked back. I bought my firs VW. It was a 2004.5 Jetta GLI. Recaro interio and BBS wheels. I traded that in after 09 months for the upcoming and much anticipated 2006 VW GTI...with the 2.0 FSI engine. And I did. I didnt disappoint. I was the second owner of the coveted 2.0 in the valley. Naturally I was proposition by some aftermarket companies to help develp the exhaust. I chose Eurojet, who were at the time, top of the crop. Now...defunct.</p>
